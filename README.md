#  Spotify Data Analysis with Python

Welcome to my **Spotify Data Analysis** project! This is a command-line Python tool that reads a Spotify dataset and allows users to analyze, manipulate, and visualize the data through an interactive menu-driven interface.

##  Dataset Information

This project uses a CSV dataset containing **200 Spotify songs** with features like:

- `Index`
- `Song Name`
- `Artist`
- `Popularity`
- `Number of Times Charted`
- `Danceability`
- `Energy`
- ... and more.
